    "Description": "The role of the kidney is to filter blood and concentrate waste into urine. Nephrons are the functional unit of the kidney. Within the nephron, blood is filtered in the glomeruli, and waste products are concentrated and transported via the proximal and distal tubules, loops of Henle and collecting ducts. The nephron extends across the two major zones of the kidney: the cortex and the medulla. Glomeruli are located in the cortex and the tubule systems extend from the cortex into the medulla.\n\nThis kidney sample shown to the right represents a 5 µm FFPE tissue section from a 41-year-old man.\nThe sample was visualized with PanCK (epithelial cells), CD10+CD31 (proximal convoluted tubules and endothelial cells), and SYTO 83 (nuclei). In parallel, the sample was molecularly profiled with the [**GeoMx Human Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) assay**](https://www.nanostring.com/products/geomx-digital-spatial-profiler/geomx-rna-assays/geomx-whole-transcriptome-atlas/).\n\nYou can click on the cortex and medulla in the cartoon to see them outlined on the tissue image, and you can toggle the Regions of Interest (ROIs) by selecting from the data layers below.",
